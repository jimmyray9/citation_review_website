# citation_review_website
This is a website for my students to practice writing citations and reference list entries for books and websites with immediate feedback.
Based on the Harvard referencing system, the input field turns green when correct while it turns red anytime the typed text is incorrect. 
Hover over the words 'Citation' or 'Reference List Entry' in order to get the correct format for that particular reference depending on 
if it is a book or a website.
